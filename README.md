# Logging Application with PyQt5

![Logging Application Screenshot](screenshot.png)

This is a simple logging application built using PyQt5, a popular Python library for creating desktop applications. The application allows users to start and stop logging, select a directory for logging, choose a network adapter, and enter an IP address.

## Features

- Circular buttons for starting and stopping logging, with green and red colors, respectively.
- A dropdown menu to select a network adapter from the available network adapters on the PC.
- A text box for entering the IP address (rec ip) to be logged.
- A checkbox labeled "Use NET/REC" that allows the user to toggle the display of the IP address label and text box.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.x
- PyQt5 (`pip install PyQt5`)
- psutil (`pip install psutil`)

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/logging-application.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory.

```bash
cd logging-application
```

3. Run the application.

```bash
python main.py
```

4. The application window will open, showing the circular buttons for starting and stopping logging, the "Select Directory" button, the network adapter dropdown, the "Rec ip" label and text box, and the "Use NET/REC" checkbox.

5. Click the "Select Directory" button to choose the directory where the log file will be saved.

6. Select a network adapter from the dropdown menu.

7. Enter the IP address in the text box next to the "Rec ip" label. If you check the "Use NET/REC" checkbox, the IP address label and text box will be shown; otherwise, they will be hidden.

8. Click the "Start Logging" button to begin logging with the selected network adapter and IP address.

9. To stop logging, click the "Stop Logging" button.
